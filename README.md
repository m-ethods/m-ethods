I have worked a lot in ROBLOX with custom frameworks such as: **Rojo, Knit, Roact/React, Promises, Matter**, and much more.

But I'm not only limited to ROBLOX. I work a ton with APIs to make cool integrations for my games! I've worked on depoying JS-written bots to remote servers with Amazon AWS that interact with the ROBLOX API.
I worked on my very own game engine in C++ using Vulkan.
